This repository holds the codes ("median_baseline_TIRF" & "peak_intensities") used in the article "Spatio-temporal regulation of endocytic protein assembly by SH3 domain in yeast". 
"median_baseline_TIRF" was used to generate the median fluorescence intensities of the TIRF data.
"peak_intensities" was used to estimate the peak fluorescence intensities to scale the TIRF data.
